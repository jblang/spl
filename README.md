# SPL Programming Language

SPL is a somewhat Pascal-like programming language for CP/M and the Z80, which was written by Peter Schorn for use with his [AltairZ80](https://schorn.ch/altair.html) simulator.  These files were extracted from the spl.pma file available on the [programming languages](https://schorn.ch/altair_6.php) section of the AltairZ80 website.

- [spl.txt](spl.txt) contains the language specification.
- [spl.spl](spl.spl) is the main source file.
